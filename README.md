NAME
====

App::Rak::Markdown - convert App::Rak output to Markdown

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use App::Rak::Markdown;

my $rmd = App::Rak::Markdown.new;

spurt "result.md", $rmd.markdown(@output);

spurt "result.md", $rmd.run(<--unicode ¬ßlove>, :tableize<unicode>);
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `App::Rak::Markdown` distribution provides logic to convert the output of [`App::Rak`](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/App::Rak) to Markdown format.

This can either be done from captured output, or from a set of arguments to be sent to the `rak` command line script.

METHODS
=======

new
---

```raku
my $rmd = App::Rak::Markdown.new(
  break => '¬ß¬ß¬ß',  # default: '***'
);
```

The `new` method takes 1 named argument:

### :break

The string to be used / checked for between grouped items in `rak`'s output (as documented with the `--break` argument). Defaults to `"***"`.

markdown
--------

```raku
say $rmd.markdown(@output);

my $markdown = $rmd.markdown(
  @output,
  :$items,    # store # of items seen, default: don't bother
  :$files,    # store # of files seen, default: don't bother
  :$heads,    # store # of headers seen, default: don't bother
  :headers(0),  # how many levels of headers, default: 1
  :depth<##>,   # markdown string of top headers, default: "###"
  :&tableizer,  # logic to create tables, default: none
  :&splitter,   # headers split logic, default: *.split("/",$headers)
)
```

The `markdown` method takes one positional argument and an optional number of named arguments, and returns a string formatted according to Markdown rules.

It takes one positional argument: a list of lines of `rak` output.

It also takes the following optional named arguments:

  * :$items - where to store the # of items seen, default: don't bother

  * :$files - where to store the # of files seen, default: don't bother

  * :$heads - where to store the # of headers seen, default: don't bother

  * :headers - the number of header levels, defaults to 1

  * :depth - the markdown string for the top header, default "###"

  * :tableizer - logic to create tables, default: none.

  * :splitter - headers split logic, default: *.split("/",$headers)

### Creating tables

If the output from `rak` is fit to create markdown tables for (e.g. the `--unicode` option, the `:tableizer` named argument can be used to indicate a `Callable` that will be called to manage creating markdown tables.

This `Callable` is expected to be called without any arguments: in that case it should return **two** lists: the first with the names of the columns, and the second with formatting info for each column. The formatting info can be specified with the following words:

  * left - align text in column to the left

  * center - center text in colum

  * right - align text in column to the right

Any other word will cause no specific aligning to be done. 

If called **with** an argument, it should return a list with the text for each column.

Some standard rak options have a dedicated tableizer, which can be invoked by name. They currently are:

  * unicode - tableize for --unicode output

  * frequencies - tableize for --frequencies output

  * unique - tableize for --unique output

run
---

```raku
say "result.md", $rmd.run(<--unicode ¬ßlove>, :tableize<unicode>);
```

    hex | name | graph
    :- | :-: | :-:
    1F3E9 | <b>LOVE</b> HOTEL | üè©
    1F48C | <b>LOVE</b> LETTER | üíå
    1F91F | I <b>LOVE</b> YOU HAND SIGN | ü§ü

The `run` method is effectively a wrapper around the `markdown` method.

It either returns the Markdown string, or `Nil` if something went wrong, or if not enough lines were received from `rak` to make parsing to Markdown worthwhile.

The positional argument is required: it should contain the arguments to be sent to `rak`.

These named arguments can be specified with the `run` method:

  * :@out - where to store output of rak, default: don't bother

  * :@err - where to store error output of rak, default: don't bother

  * :min-lines - the minumum number of lines in output, default: 0

  * :sort(Callable?) - sort the rak output before calling .markdown

Note that the `:@out` named argument only makes sense if the `:min-lines` argument also has been specified with a value greater than 0.

All other named arguments that `markdown` can receive, can also be specified here and will be passed on to the `markdown` method:

  * :$items - where to store the # of items seen, default: don't bother

  * :$files - where to store the # of files seen, default: don't bother

  * :$heads - where to store the # of headers seen, default: don't bother

  * :headers - the number of header levels, defaults to 1

  * :depth - the markdown string for the top header, default "###"

  * :tableizer - logic to create tables, default: none.

  * :splitter - headers split logic, default: *.split("/",$headers)
